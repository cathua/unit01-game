## Overview
This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including jQuery and Bootstrap). I utilized fonts and [sprites](https://dribbble.com/shots/1558327-Fruits-8bit) from an external site (all included within this repo) to enhance my HTML and CSS. The game, titled "8-bit Bakeshoppe", users assemble cupcakes to match the large cupcake presented to the user on the screen. Upon pressing 'Order Up!', the score will increase if the user's submission is correct.  

The process for this game began with establishing the ultimate goal for this project: creating a simple, engaging game featuring unique designs and visuals. This goal would be a means through which I could showcase my mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After creating a simple wireframe (pictured below), each day spent on this project was a "sprint". The goals for each sprint were to build and enhance the HTML/CSS wireframe, and to expand the game's functions based on user stories.  

## Features
#### Current Features
* Customizable cupcake for the user
* Randomly generated cupcake to recreate
* Increasing score (for successful cupcake creation)  
#### Future Features
* Functional countdown timer (the user can make as many cupcakes as they can in the allotted time)
* Ability to log player's score
* Randomized "customer" sprites
  * The sprite will look upset if the user takes too long
* Instructions modal box
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Alternative themes
* Responsiveness  

## Current Bugs
Currently, the timer in the upper left corner counts up instead of down. The user is able to still play the game when the timer is paused. Additionally, I am continuing to work toward creating a more responsive app, and sorting out some of the hard-coded item placements.  

## Overall Impressions
This game was challenging in ways that I had hoped to challenge myself. I also encountered issues that I had not encountered before. Overall, the big win from this project was creating something that looked like a "real", presentable product. Creating the pixel cupcake (entirely out of divs in HTML!) was a challenge that I was proud to overcome, and I was also happy that I became more comfortable with bootstrap, jQuery, and writing complex functions.  
  
I definitely felt as though, however, I struggled to write DRY code. Give the time constraints, I was motivated to create workable solutions rather than elegant ones, and I hope to go back and be able to clean up my project and increase efficiency in addition to adding more robust features.

## Additional Credits and Shoutouts
Thank you to the CODA program for giving me the opportunity to learn how to code.  
A huge thank-you to the General Assembly instructors and assistants for being fantastic teachers and mentors throughout this process.  
A major thank-you to my friends and family who were willing to celebrate my successes with me, and be a resource when I struggled.  
And lastly... a huge thank-you to W3Schools, the Mozilla Developer Network, Stack Overflow, and Google. Thank you for being there late at night, early in the morning, and always willing to listen to my questions. I couldn't have done this without you.
