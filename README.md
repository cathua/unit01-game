For this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including jQuery and Bootstrap). I utilized fonts and [sprites](https://dribbble.com/shots/1558327-Fruits-8bit) from an external site (all included within this repo) to enhance my HTML and CSS. 

Instructions: Make a cupcake that matches the customer's orders. Do as many orders as you can before time runs out!

To customize your cupcake, click the cupcake flavors to change your base. Then change your frosting flavor, add sprinkles and toppings, and you're good to go!
